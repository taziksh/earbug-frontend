7 ESLint rules behave differently from their TSLint counterparts:
  * @typescript-eslint/quotes:
    - Option "jsx-double" is not supported by ESLint.
  * brace-style:
    - ESLint's brace-style will check all tokens.
  * react/jsx-no-bind:
    - ESLint rule 'jsx-no-bind' also checks for Function.bind
  * no-console:
    - Custom console methods, if they exist, will no longer be allowed.
  * @typescript-eslint/no-unused-expressions:
    - The TSLint optional config "allow-new" is the default ESLint behavior and will no longer be ignored.
  * eqeqeq:
    - Option "smart" allows for comparing two literal values, evaluating the value of typeof and null comparisons.
  * no-underscore-dangle:
    - Leading and trailing underscores (_) on identifiers will now be ignored.

Error: multiple output react/jsx-no-bind ESLint rule options were generated, but tslint-to-eslint-config doesn't have "merger" logic to deal with this.
Please file an issue at https://github.com/typescript-eslint/tslint-to-eslint-config/issues/new?template=missing_merger.md. Thanks!
